## Common Questions (FAQ)

### About VERA Itself

**Q: Is VERA a therapist?**
A: No. VERA is a supportive wellness tool that uses AI to provide guidance, but cannot diagnose, treat, or replace professional therapy. Think of VERA as a compassionate companion who helps you regulate, not a medical provider.

**Q: How is VERA different from other mental health apps?**
A: VERA combines conversational AI with somatic techniques. Most apps are either meditation tools or journal apps - VERA does real-time dialogue with nervous system expertise built in. Plus, 24/7 availability and voice features make it unique.

**Q: Can VERA help with depression?**
A: VERA can support mood through connection and grounding techniques, but severe depression requires professional help. VERA is best for situational mood support, not clinical depression treatment.

**Q: What if I'm having a crisis?**
A: VERA is not for acute crisis. If you're in immediate danger, call 911 or your local crisis line. VERA is designed for everyday stress and nervous system support, not emergencies.
